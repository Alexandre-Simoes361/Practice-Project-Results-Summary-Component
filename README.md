## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Other than getting more practice with positioning elements/dimensioning them (which can be a whole headache all on its own), this project didn't really bring in anything new. I did, however, learn a little better how wildcard selectors work (and that they don't target children).

### Continued development

I've been feeling like a lot of code is wasted positioning/aligning text properly, and it's something I would like to work on.
